# Geospatial-Real-Estate-Price-Predictor

# Work in progress 

This project is a geospatial real estate price predictor that uses machine learning to predict the price of real estate based on various geospatial features. The project uses web scraping to collect data on real estate listings, as well as data on nearby amenities such as parks, schools, and shopping centers. The collected data is then used to train a machine learning model that can predict the price of real estate based on its location and nearby amenities.
